Plugins group and comment.

== Description ==

Plugins can be sorted into several groups and filtered accordingly.

Each plugin can be provided with a private comment.

In addition, a "details" link appears on each plug, through which you look at the corresponding page on
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ appearance (if the plugin is hosted there),
just as the result of the plugins install page (wp-admin/plugin-install.php).

= Licence =
Good news, this plugin is free for everyone!
Since it's released under the GPL, you can use it free of charge on your personal or commercial blog.
But if you enjoy this plugin, you can thank me and leave a [small donation](http://fnse.de/Spenden/)
for the time I've spent writing and supporting this plugin.
And I really don't want to know how many hours of my life this plugin has already eaten ;)

= Translations =
The plugin comes with various translations, please refer to the
[WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_in_Your_Language "Installing WordPress in Your Language")
for more information about activating the translation. If you want to help to translate the plugin to your language,
please have a look at the .pot file which contains all defintions and may be used with a [gettext](http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/)
editor like [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/) (Windows) or plugin for WordPress [Localization](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/codestyling-localization/).
